# rust-winui-experiments
Rust + Windows Composition and WinUI experiments and samples

* Requires Rust nightly

* Depends on the experimental `combase-macro` branch of `winrt-rust`: https://github.com/contextfree/winrt-rust/tree/combase-macro . This needs to be cloned into a sibling directory to the one this is cloned into.
